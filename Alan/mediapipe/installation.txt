Requirements: latest version of OpenCV

-Activate your virtual environment and install via pip:
pip install mediapipe

-hands.py will detect the position of the wrist node (#0) and write the positions of the node on every frame that the node is present to wrist_sequential.csv.
-hands_onelinecsv.py will also detect and write the wrist node position, but will only save the last detected node position in wrist_single.csv.

-the wrist positions are relative to the cv2 output-- (x, y) = (0, 0) corresponds to the top right corner of the screen, and (x, y) = (1, 1) corresponds to the bottom left corner.

Please run any of the tests and see how the frame rate/tracking ability is. Let me know if performance issues come up. ty
