# Unity Assets

Scripts and assets required for each of the scenes in Cooking Bruin. Different assets are divided by scene/minigame folders and all scripts are contained in the **Scripts** folder. Additional food assets downloaded from the Unity store are also stored here for use throughout the project.

The three scenes within the Unity project are:
- Main Menu
- Chop Chop
- Pick Me
