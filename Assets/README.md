# Unity Assets

Scripts and assets required for each of the scenes in Cooking Bruin. Different assets are divided by minigame folders. All scripts are contained in the **Scripts** folder and all scenes are contained in the **Scenes** folder. Additional food assets downloaded from the Unity store are also stored here for use throughout the project.

The main three minigames are:
- Thinky Think
- Fry Fry
- Picky Pick
